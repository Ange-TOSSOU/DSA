# Data Structures Easy to Advanced Course
This is a full free tutorial from freeCodeCamp.org, given by a Google Engineer, William Fiset. You will find it [here][mooc_material] on their Youtube channel.

I created this repository to store all my implementations for this tutorial. Feel free to take a look and give me your feedback.

The course is split up into multiple parts.
